# BoomBikes Bike Sharing — Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

This project analyzes BoomBikes’ daily bike‑rental data to identify key factors influencing demand and to build a predictive Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model.

## Objectives
- Understand how weather, seasonality, holidays, and working days impact rental counts.
- Select the most meaningful predictors using feature‑selection and diagnostic methods.
- Build a clear, interpretable model to support business planning and demand forecasting.

## Project Workflow
- Data loading and initial exploration
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and scaling
- Feature selection using statistical and model‑based approaches
- Model development using linear regression
- Evaluation through statistical summaries, R², and diagnostic checks
- Interpretation of influential factors on bike rentals

## Key Insights (Typical Patterns)
- Demand tends to rise in pleasant seasons and decrease during harsh weather.
- Temperature positively influences rentals up to a comfort threshold.
- Working‑day vs. holiday patterns show different usage trends.

## Deliverables
- Cleaned and prepared dataset
- Final selected feature set
- Regression model and evaluation metrics
- Business insights and recommendations

## Getting Started
- Place day.csv in project directory
- Run the script to execute EDA

## Recommended Actions
- Optimize bike availability during high‑demand seasons and favorable weather conditions.
- Apply targeted promotions for low‑demand days.
- Use the MLR model as a baseline for more advanced forecasting methods.
